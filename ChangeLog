	* win/Makefile.in - fixed because of new definition of
	TCL_SRC_DIR and TK_SRC_DIR

2000-07-12 Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>
	* Changed the HELP_DIR to be configurable so I could have parallel
		builds not all trying to create the same help files.

2000-07-12 Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>
	* tcl/win/configure.in, common.bc, common.vc
	    Fixed version number to 8.3
	* {tcl,tk}/unix/Makefile.in, tweaks to get references to LIB_RUNTIME_DIR
	    properly expanded on irix builds.  Also added BUILDHELP macro
	    that is conditional on nroff being present so we don't try to
	    build help files on systems with out nroff.

	* tcl/win/tclXAppInit.c, tk/generic/tkXshell.c, tk/win/tkXAppInit.c
