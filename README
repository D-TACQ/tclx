EXTENDED TCL
============

    Extended Tcl (TclX), defines a set of extensions to Tcl 6.5, the Tool
Command Language invented by Dr. John Ousterhout of the University of
California at Berkeley.  Tcl is a powerful, yet simple embeddable programming
language.  Extended Tcl is oriented towards system programming tasks, with
many additional interfaces to the Unix operating system, It is upwardly
compatible with Tcl 6.5.  You take the Extended Tcl package, add it to Tcl
6.5, and from that you get Extended Tcl.  (Berkeley Tcl is not included in
this distribution, obtain it from sprite.berkeley.edu).

   Support is also included for building a Tk 3.0 wish shell (wishx) with the
Extended Tcl command set.

    Extended Tcl was designed and implemented by Karl Lehenbauer
(karl@NeoSoft.com) and Mark Diekhans (markd@Grizzly.com), with help in the
early stages from Peter da Silva (peter@NeoSoft.com).

   As with Berkeley Tcl, all of Extended Tcl is freely redistributable,
including for commercial use and resale.

   Please read this file carefully before building and installing Extended Tcl.


FEATURES ADDED BY EXTENDED TCL
==============================

   Here is a summary of the features added by Extended Tcl.  For more details
on the commands and functionality provided by Extended Tcl, see the manual
page man/TclX.man.

    o A shell, which provides an environment for developing and executing
      Tcl programs.  

    o Advanced Tcl code library facility.

    o General purpose commands which define new programming constructs,
      debugging and profiling facilities.

    o Unix access commands provide access to many Unix system calls, including
      process management.

    o File I/O commands provided added facilities for accessing and
      manipulating open files.

    o File scanning facility that provides awk-like functionality.

    o Math commands (random, sin, cos, etc).

    o Extended list manipulation commands

    o Keyed lists, a type of list that provided functionality similar to C
      structures.

    o Extended string and character manipulation commands.

    o Time and date manipulation and conversion commands.

ON-LINE HELP
============

    There is a help system included with Extended Tcl.  It contains some
documentation on every command in Berkeley Tcl, and Extended Tcl.  You can
invoke it interactively from within Extended Tcl by typing "help".

    Once you bring Tcl up and have gotten it to pass all the tests, try typing
"help help" to learn how to use help.

MANUAL PAGES
============

    Man pages in nroff/troff format are provided for all of Tcl and the
extensions in the directory tclX6.5c/man.  Start with the TclX.man manual.

EXTENDED TCL VERSION NAMING
===========================

    Extended Tcl takes its version number from the corresponding version of
Berkeley (Ousterhout) Tcl upon which it is based, with the addition of a
trailing letter in case there are multiple releases of Extended Tcl within a
single release of Berkeley Tcl.  This release is TclX 6.5c.

INTERFACING TCL AND C++
=======================

C++ programmers can include the file "tcl++.h" to define C++ classes
that can be used to access a Tcl interpreter.  This is based on Tcl
C++ classes originally developed by Parag Patel.

TCL DIRECTORY HIERARCHY
=======================

Here is an overview of the directory hierarchy:

                             top_level_directory

                          tcl6.5    tclX6.5c   tk3.0

The tcl6.5 directory contains Berkeley Tcl, unmodified and tk3.0 contains
unmodified tk3.0, if you plan to use Tk.  These locations are only suggested,
they maybe changed by editing tclX6.5c/Config.mk.

The following directories are included under the tclX6.5c directory:

    o config - Configuration files for various Unix versions.

    o man - Unformated manual pages for TclX.

    o src - The main source for TclX.

    o osSupport - Library routines required by TclX that may not be available
      on all Unix versions. 

    o ucbsrc - A makefile and sed scripts used to modify source files that
      are supplied with UCB Tcl.  The files are modified with sed so you don't
      have to have patch to build Tcl, however context diffs are provided if
      problems occur porting to a new version of Tcl.

    o tclsrc - Tcl source that is built into the Tcl package library.

    o tcllib - Tcl source and runtime environment that is required to run TclX.

    o tcllib/help - Help files for Tcl and TclX.

    o tests - Tests for TclX.

    o tkucbsrc - A makefile and sed scripts used to modify source files that
      are supplied with Tk to add in TclX functionality.  Context diffs are
      also provided.

    o tksrc - A makefile that builds a version of the Tk wish shell containing
      Extended Tcl.

    o experimental - An directory of expermintal and contributed Tcl source.
      The code is not normally built as part of TclX.

HOW TO BUILD IT
===============

   Please read TclX.man in the tclX6.5c/man directory before starting the
engine or working under the hood.

    Configure and build Berkeley Tcl as described in that distribution.  Don't
forget to do a "csh config" before running make for the first time.

    Cd to the "tclX6.5c" directory, which contains this distribution.  Edit the
file "Config.mk" to configure Extended Tcl for your Unix version and your
preferences.  The first part of this file contains user preference options,
including the location of the Berkeley Tcl source and, optionally, the Tk 3.0
source.  A macro TCL_CONFIG_FILE is also defined that points to a Unix system
configuration file in the "config" directory.  There should be one there for
your system.  If not, you will have to develop one based on the documentation
in "Config.mk".  If you develop or fix problems in a configuration file,
please send it to us at the address below.

   It is important to set the value for TCL_MASTERDIR in Config.mk before
compiling TclX.

    Now do a "make".  If all goes well, this will augment the tcl.a library
will all of the functions defined by both Berkeley and Extended Tcl, and
create an executable version of tcl in the "tclX6.5c" directory called, simply
enough, "tcl".  A "wishx" executable will be also built if it was requested.

    Until the Extended Tcl runtime files are installed, "tcl" and "wishx" can't
be run directly.  To run them before installation, use "runtcl" or "runwishx".

    Next enter the command "runtcl" and, if everything worked, you should be
greeted by a tcl prompt:

tcl>

    If you are using Tk and desired to have the information from the Tk
command manual pages available in the Tcl help system, build them with the
command:

    make buildtkhelp


RUN TESTS TO INSURE THAT TCL IS WORKING PROPERLY
================================================

    Tcl and TclX come with over 1400 tests that you can run to insure that it
is working properly.  These tests have greatly helped us while working on Tcl
by detecting bugs that get introduced accidentally as side-effects of changes.
Consequently, we have found Tcl to be very reliable, and have had very few
cases where a new release has regressed by introducing new bugs in old
functions, or reintroducing old bugs in old functions.

   There are two sets of tests: the tests from Berkeley Tcl, and tests for
Extended Tcl, which test both the new commands added by Extended Tcl and the
procedures defined in the Tcl procedure library.

    Run both the Berkeley and TclX tests by typing "make test" in the Extended
directory.

    If a test fails, please dig into the test and the C source for the function
being tested, fix the bug and mail us the change.  If you're not inclined to
do this, please report the problem, including the output of the test, to
tcl-project@neosoft.com.  Sometimes tests fail due to problems in the system
environment or bugs in that test rather than problems with TclX.  Even if a few
of the tests fail, you probably still have a working TclX.

   If you're having trouble with the Berkeley tests, and you suspect that the
extensions might be involved, you can build a special minimal version of
Berkeley Tcl by cd'ing to the tcl6.5 directory and doing a "make tclTest".
You can then invoke "tclTest", where you should be greeted by a "%" prompt.
Next, cd to the tests directory and do a "source all".

    Note that the Berkeley tests turn off tcl's ability to autoload procedures
from the Tcl source library, so after running the tests, you should usually
exit Tcl and restart it.

    You will not be able to run the Tk demos with wishx until after Extended
Tcl has been installed.  At that time, you can run the demos with a procedure
"tkdemo".  This is handy for showing Tk off to you friends.

INSTALLING EXTENDED TCL
=======================

    To install Extended Tcl, edit the tclX6.5c/Config.mk installation
configuration section to match your preferences. Read the information in 
Config.mk carefully before configuring it.  TCL_MASTERDIR must have been
set before compiling TclX.

    The master directory name will have the Tcl version number appended to
it, which allows multiple versions of Tcl to be installed.


    Cd to the tclX6.5c directory and do a "make install" (normally as root).
This will install include files and manual pages for Berkeley Tcl and TclX, as
well as the TclX binary and library.

PACKAGE LIBRARIES
=================

    Package Libraries are a Tcl source code management tool included in
this release.  Package libraries allow you to group Tcl procedures into
logical bundles and create single files, libraries, that contain multiple
packages.  The package code provides a low-overhead means of automatically
demand-loading a package on the first attempt to execute one of the procedures
defined within it.  As such, package libraries provide a mechanism to
accommodate the creation of Tcl applications and libraries of a substantial
size.

   Note that the package library mechanism takes the place of the "tclIndex"
mechanism that comes with UCB Tcl.  These type of libraries can be loaded by
Extended Tcl, but the commands and variables described in the Tcl manual are
not available.

LINKING TCL APPLICATIONS
========================

   The libraries (libtcl.a, libtk.a) built by Extended Tcl are super sets
of the libraries produced by standard Tcl and Tk.  If you call the 
Tcl_CreateInterp routine, you get the standard Tcl command set, if you
call Tcl_CreatedExtendedInterp, you get the extended command set.  Calling
Tcl_Startup or Tcl_SehllEnvInit, you get the Extended Tcl startup mechanism
and package libraries, otherwise you get the standard Tcl libraries.


SUPPORT FOR EXTENDED TCL
========================

    We are committed to providing continuing support for Extended Tcl.  Please
send questions, bug reports, and bug fixes to:

         tcl-project@NeoSoft.com (uupsi!sugar!tcl-project)

Or leave a note on our BBS at (713) 684-5900

SEND US YOUR LIBRARY ROUTINES
=============================

    If you write a useful Tcl procedure and would like to share it with
everyone, send us a copy and we'll consider it for the Tcl library!

COMPATIBILITY WITH TclX 6.4c
============================

   We have attempted to main backwards-compatibility with older versions
of TclX.  A few changes were made to enhance usability or fix problems that
have introduced a few incompatibilities, these are listed below.  Remember
that multiple versions of Tcl may be installed on a system using the Tcl
default file, so you don't have to convert everything at once.

  o Only set SIGINT to cause an error if the Tcl shell or wish is reading
    commands from stdin.

  o Renamed the Extended Tcl wish shell to "wishx", so both extended and
    standard versions can be installed on the system.

CAVEATS
=======

    Although Extended Tcl compiles and executes the tests properly on SCO Unix
System V/3.2.4, Xenix System V/386, and SunOS, it has not had much use under
Xenix System V/386.

    Previous versions of Extended Tcl have also run under Berkeley BSD, HP-UX
and Xenix/286.  This release, however, has not been tested on these machines,
although there is configuration information in the makefile for BSD and HP-UX,
and Extended Tcl should come up fairly easily on these machines.

    Do not create any set-user-id versions of Tcl yet.  There are holes in
the startup sequence involving shell variables and default files that need
to be plugged first.

TCL USENET NEWSGROUP
