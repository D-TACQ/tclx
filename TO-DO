                         TclX bug, idea and task list
*** Serious Bugs ***
o objcmd writing man page not installed.
o common.vc added -DTCLX_LIBRARY to all cc calls.  This breaks tclXlib.c
   as it has a variable by the same name.

*** Minor bugs and enhancements ***
From: ellson@hotair.hobl.lucent.com
    Just a small gripe.   Could you please arrange the tclX Makefiles
    so that they don't depend on libtcl8.0.so in tcl's build area?
    This is causing me some problems when building tclX on my laptop with 
    limited disk space.  You should be able to use the installed versions
    of the libraries so that the tcl and tk build areas can be kept clean.

o add man compress install
o Need to either document how namspaces are used in #@package or normalize
  them as with auto_qualify.  

o Added --with-tcl and --with-tk dir
  (requested by sstanton@ghostwheel.Eng.Sun.COM)
    >You might want to take a look at the configuration files for expect.  It does 
    >a great job of handling this case, including looking for internal Tcl header 
    >files, etc.
o Allow configure to work from other directories.

o Better doc on package require.

o Testing of package require in test scripts.

o Add math functions for string compares ceq(), clt, cgt and for
  list compares?

o Convert sleep command to use Tcl_Sleep.  Perhaps just convert it to
  a proc that calls after.

o Use Tcl_RegExpCompile and Tcl_RegExpExec.

o Use install-sh for installation.

o tkdemo proc is not installed.

o tclhelp is not built for windows.

o syslog interface.  Commands that give explicit access to syslog, plus
  a channel that lets one write to syslog.  Should be able to dup channel
  to have both stdout and stderr go to the same channel.  Need a dup
  fconfigure option.

o Making packages out of some of the new TclX functionallity, such as 
  syslog idea above.

o Install instructions for WinDozes.

o Help change to search for file path tail needs documented and tests.
