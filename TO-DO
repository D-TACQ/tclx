                         TclX bug, idea and task list

o Convert sleep command to use Tcl_Sleep.  Perhaps just convert it to
  a proc that calls after.

o Use Tcl_RegExpCompile and Tcl_RegExpExec.

o Use install-sh for installation.

o tkdemo proc is not installed.

o tclhelp is not built for windows.

o syslog interface.  Commands that give explicit access to syslog, plus
  a channel that lets one write to syslog.  Should be able to dup channel
  to have both stdout and stderr go to the same channel.  Need a dup
  fconfigure option.

o Making packages out of some of the new TclX functionallity, such as 
  syslog idea above.

o Remove check for whitespace in keyedlist field names.

o Install instructions.
