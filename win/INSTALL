                        Building TclX on Windows 95/NT

To build the alpha 1 release:
   o The patch win/tclWinSock.c.diff must be applied to the Tcl 7.5
     distribution and Tcl 7.5 recompiled and installed.
    

In the alpha 1 release, the following restrictions apply:

    o Support is only provided for Visual C++ 4.0.

    o The id command is limited, only the host and process options are
      implemented

    o The chmod, chown, chgrp, fcntl commands are not yet implemented.

    o There are probably several problems with using open sockets with commands
      that operate on open files.
    
    o The select command probably does nothing useful.

    o No support for installing TclX, the runtime.
