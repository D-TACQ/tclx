                        Building TclX on Windows 95/NT

Welcome to the alpha 1 release of TclX 7.5.3

  This is an early alpha release, the code is nor production quality.  A
lot of work is left to do.  It is being made available for those who
want to contribute to the porting effort.

Please send mail to the authors of this port to tcl-project@neosoft.com.

The alpha release is available in:
        ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/tcl/tclx-distrib/tclX7.5.3-a1.tar.gz

To build the release:
   o You need Visual C++ 4.0 (per standard Tcl instructions).  Contributions
     of a Borland C++ makefile would be welcome (and a donation of a licensed
     copy of the current Borland C++ even more welcome).
     
   o The patch win/tclWinSock.c.diff must be applied to the Tcl 7.5
     distribution and Tcl 7.5 recompiled and the DLL reinstalled.
    
   o Tcl 7.5 should be in a directory adjacent to the tclX7.5.3a1 directory
     or the paths in makefile.vc need to be changed.

   o Edit win/tclXwinPort.h to set TCLX_LIBRARY to full path to
     tclX7.5.3a1/tcl/win.  If anyone can tell me how to pass a string
     #define on the command line using nmake, this can be moved to
     makefile.vc.  This is a short term hack. The runtime environment
     is generate in this directory and should remain here for all
     testing.
        
   o To compile, cd to tclX7.5.3a1/tcl/win and enter the command:

        nmake -f makefile.vc

   o To run the TclX tests:

        nmake -f makefile.vc test
   

   o If you want to debug under MS Developer Studio, its easy to wrap a
     workspace around the existing makefile.vc:
        o Select File->Open
        o In the Open dialog:
            o Set the "Files of Type" field to be "All Files (*.*)"
            o Set the "Open As" field to be "Makefile"
            o Now select "tclX7.5.3a1/tcl/win/makefile.vc" using the
              standard open dialog.
        o A warning dialog will come up asking if you want to wrap a
          workspace around the makefile.  Answer "Yes'.
        o A Save As dialog will appear with the "File name" field
          default to "makefile1.mak".  Change this to be "tclx.mak".
        o Press "Save".
        o You can now use File->Open Workspace to open "tclx.mdp".

In the alpha 1 release, the following restrictions apply:

    o Support is only provided for Visual C++ 4.0.

    o No wishx is built, but you should able to load the TclX DLL into a
      standard wish.

    o The following commands are not supported:
       o fork

    o The following commands are not yet implemented:
       o chmod
       o chown
       o chgrp
       o fcntl
       o link
       o kill

    o The following commands are there, but not tested, since the tests have
      not been ported.
        o signal
        o dup

    o The select command only works on sockets.
      
    o The id command is limited, only the host and process options are
      implemented

    o There are probably problems with using open sockets and pipes with
      commands that operate on open files.
    
    o No support for installing TclX or setting the runtime path.  You
        
    o No 16 bit support.

    o Documentation has not been updated to indicate windows differences.

    o fork does not work, but execl creates a process and returns its
      process id.
